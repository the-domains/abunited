# A star is born....

Couldn't be more excited about this young prospect and who he will be partnering up with up front! Will it be a product from our youth academy, Marcus Rashford (more on him to come!) or will it be a player we purchase that will come in with his own ego and own set of skills? Stay tuned to discuss.
