**This is it, the place for everything Manchester United and world football, mostly Manchester United but analyzing all aspects of the football club will get us in interesting topics regarding world football leagues, players, managers, business, strategies and leadership. I will try to tie in the team with my business topics and opinions to make it enjoyable and clear to anyone that is a fan of football and business, mostly Manchester United :) More to come!**

_Starting to jot some ideas down but the first that comes to mind that we need to discuss is of course our skipper, Wayne Rooney. We will discuss what kind of player he is and if he were in the workplace what kind of employee or friend he would be. My position is that he has so many doubters and people that criticize his every move from when he was 16 - for 14 years, but no player has done anything similar for as long as him with as much pressure. _
